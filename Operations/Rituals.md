# Rituals

## All hands
We have an all hands meeting every two weeks. We start by pledging to the creed. 

# StandUps
When we have standups, we start by talking about culture. One person is expected to read one phrase of the creed and offer a brief reflection on it.


## Arriving
When in person or in meetings we are present.
