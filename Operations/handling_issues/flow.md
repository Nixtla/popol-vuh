# Handling Issues, Bugs, and Errors

## 🐞 Introduction
This document outlines the process for handling user-reported issues, bugs, and errors. 

The goal is to ensure that user-reported issues are well-documented, promptly addressed, and resolved in a timely manner.

Ultimately, all issues regarding TimeGPT and TimeGEN should be reported in the [Nixtla/Nixtla](https://github.com/Nixtla/nixtla) repository.


## 🐛 Process
User-reported issues can originate from various sources such as Ops Mails, Slack, Readme, Social Media, and GitHub. These issues must be well-documented to facilitate debugging. @tracykteal is responsible for creating an issue on [Nixtla/Nixtla](https://github.com/Nixtla/nixtla) and notifying the user of its creation. @elephaint will suggest internal assignments, directing issues to the appropriate team members: @elephaint, @MMenchero, @marcopeix, and @Yibei990826 for TimeGPT Model; @jmoralez for TimeGPT Backend; Web for Accounts, Dashboards, and Pricing; @AzulGarza for unresolvable issues; and @MMenchero or @tracykteal for R SDK. Assigned team members will create mirror issues if necessary and work on resolving them. Once resolved, the original issue is closed, and the user is informed of the resolution.
