# Where we come from, who we are 

## 💫 Origin Story

It started as a side project. We built some tools for an old company we used to work for. Then, everybody took his own path, some went to academics and got Ph. D.s some founded companies and some kept coding and shipping products. We never thought it would grow so much. We decided to reunite and make this our life. We founded Nixtla. We thought it was going to be just another open-source library, but it soon became the most comprehensive time-series ecosystem in the world. We decided to dream big and started challenging the status quo. We dared the big players in the industry like Facebook, Amazon, and Google, and won. We showed that a bunch of nerds armed with the power of open-source contributions could beat in accuracy and performance of the biggest companies in the world. Soon after we experienced exponential growth in usage and adoption. Our community grew. And we grew with them. Nixtla is now the most used library in the world and some of the brightest minds in the industry and academia are using us.

But we couldn't stay put. We wanted a bigger challenge. So we took the biggest question we could find in our field and worked hard on it. Now we are the proud pioneers in Large Time models. This innovation will allow us to share the future with everybody.

## 💁🏽‍♂️ Who we are? 🇲🇽🏳️‍⚧️🇦🇷

We are a bunch of hackers, motivated primarily by curiosity and a desire to make a meaningful impact in the digital realm we love so much. Our shared passion is understanding the world and everything that surrounds us. Our backgrounds are diverse - we've been researchers, developers, engineers, managers, actors, philosophers, and mathematicians. Now, we've united as founders with the ambitious goal to revolutionize the data field. In some ways, we're still in our old apartments, discovering Linux for the first time, writing small programs in Bash, or surfing the early internet.

We firmly believe that the future belongs to everyone. Our roots extend to Latin America; we're not products of Stanford or the Bay Area, but individuals who champion diversity. We're queer; we're different, and we're proud.

Together, we're not just shaping Nixtla, we're shaping the future of  data science.

## 🤔 What does Nixtla mean?

"Nixtla" in Nahuatl means period of time.  Nahuatl is a language spoken by indigenous people in Mexico and Central America, notably the Aztecs. We chose that name to reflect the origin of the company and highlight our diverse backgrounds.
