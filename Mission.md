Nixtla is to numbers what Anthropic or Open AI are to language and images. We are the creators of TimeGPT. With our pre-trained model, an enterprise can upload its data and predict. Saving millions of dollars and months of development and maintenance. TimeGPT was trained on the largest collection of data in history ‚Äì over 100 billion rows of financial, weather, energy, and web data ‚Äì and democratizes the power of time-series analysis. Before TimeGPT Nixtla created the most comprehensive time series ecosystem, with more than 7 million downloads. Nixtla‚Äôs open source software is currently used in production by companies like Amazon, Walmart, Meta, and Accenture.

At Nixtla, we are committed to unlocking the potential of data, and extending the revolutionary algorithms that fuel advanced AI systems like GPT and Midjourney to the realm of time. Buried within the ceaseless flux of time lie countless nuggets of wisdom, not encapsulated in words or images, but in the rhythmic pulses of time-bound data.

We recognize that the heart of knowledge lies in uncertainty reduction - the continuous pursuit to anticipate and plan for what's next. Whether it's a bank forecasting market trends or a retailer predicting product demand, the capacity to accurately foresee the future is a crucial competitive edge. It's this ability that empowers giants like Amazon, Uber, and Walmart to deliver exactly what you need, precisely when and where you need it.

However, what if you don't have the resources of these massive corporations at your disposal? This is where Nixtla steps in. Our mission is to democratize the future. We provide businesses of all sizes, across all industries, with state-of-the-art forecasting tools that enable them to reduce uncertainty and make data-driven decisions. With Nixtla, you can implement cutting-edge forecasting and advanced anomaly detection, irrespective of your team's size or technical expertise.

With Nixtla, you don't just glimpse into the future - you query it, comprehend it, and act upon it. We are invested in your future. Embrace the power of prediction. Gain confidence. Minimize uncertainty. Together, let's change the world, one forecast at a time.

## üí´ Origin Story

It started as a side project. We built some tools for an old company we used to work for. Then, everybody took his own path, some went to academics and got Ph. D.s some founded companies and some kept coding and shipping products. We never thought it would grow so much. We decided to reunite and make this our life. We founded Nixtla. We thought it was going to be just another open-source library, but it soon became the most comprehensive time-series ecosystem in the world. We decided to dream big and started challenging the status quo. We dared the big players in the industry like Facebook, Amazon, and Google, and won. We showed that a bunch of nerds armed with the power of open-source contributions could beat in accuracy and performance of the biggest companies in the world. Soon after we experienced exponential growth in usage and adoption. Our community grew. And we grew with them. Nixtla is now the most used library in the world and some of the brightest minds in the industry and academia are using us.

But we couldn't stay put. We wanted a bigger challenge. So we took the biggest question we could find in our field and worked hard on it. Now we are the proud pioneers in Large Time models. This innovation will allow us to share the future with everybody.

## üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Who we are?

We are a bunch of hackers, motivated primarily by curiosity and a desire to make a meaningful impact in the digital realm we love so much. Our shared passion is understanding the world and everything that surrounds us. Our backgrounds are diverse - we've been researchers, developers, engineers, managers, actors, philosophers, and mathematicians. Now, we've united as founders with the ambitious goal to revolutionize the data field. In some ways, we're still in our old apartments, discovering Linux for the first time, writing small programs in Bash, or surfing the early internet.

We firmly believe that the future belongs to everyone. Our roots extend to Latin America; we're not products of Stanford or the Bay Area, but individuals who champion diversity. We're queer; we're different, and we're proud.

Together, we're not just shaping Nixtla, we're shaping the future of  data science.

## üí∏¬†Investors

We have raised 6.2M dollar in total. Our Seed Round was led by True Ventures (Tony Schneider). We also have incredible investors like GPV (DJ Patil), Google Founders Fund and founders/execs from Twilio, Snorkel, Hugging Face, Lighting AI and Nginx.

## ü§î¬†What does Nixtla mean?

"Nixtla" in Nahuatl means period of time.  Nahuatl is a language spoken by indigenous people in Mexico and Central America, notably the Aztecs. We chose that name to reflect the origin of the company and highlight our diverse backgrounds.
