# Hiring Policies

We are commited to create a diverse culture and organization by design. We believe strive in our hiring pratices to maintain at lest a 50% quote of underepresented groups in our team.


Note to self: This could mean that 50% is represented by a single group, or that 50% is represented by a combination of undereprented groups. Concretly, a bunch of men.
