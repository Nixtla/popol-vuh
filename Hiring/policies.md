## Diversity and Inclusion Index

To solidify our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment, we have established the Diversity and Inclusion Index (D&I Index). This Index is designed to quantitatively assess our progress in promoting diversity and ensuring the representation of underrepresented groups within our organization.

### Formula:
$$
\text{DI Index} = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{1} \{E_i \in \cup_{j=1}^M A_j\}}{N}  > 0.5
$$

### Target:

Our goal is to maintain a D&I Index greater than 0.5, reflecting a workforce where over 50% of our employees come from underrepresented groups.

### Parameters:

- **Underrepresented Groups (A)**: This includes but is not limited to individuals from varying ethnic backgrounds, genders, age groups, abilities, and other demographic categories that are underrepresented in the workforce.
- $N$: total headcount of our organization.
- $M$: the total number of underrepresented groups.

### Commitment:

We are unwavering in our dedication to achieving and sustaining this target, recognizing that a diverse and inclusive workforce is pivotal to fostering innovation, creativity, and excellence. We will regularly assess our D&I Index, taking proactive steps to address any disparities and ensure that our workplace is welcoming, respectful, and supportive for all.


## Mathematical Expression for the Utility of Remote Work in Talent Acquisition

Considering that a diverse pool of talent contributes positively to the utility function of an organization, we can express the relationship between remote work, diversity, and utility mathematically.

Let:
- $U$ represent the utility function of the organization.
- $D$ represent the diversity of the talent pool.
- $T$ represent the size of the talent pool.
- $R$ be a binary variable representing the work arrangement, where $R = 1$ for remote work and $R = 0$ for traditional in-office work.

### Postulate:
More diversity leads to a greater utility function: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial D}>0$.

### Expression:
Given that remote work allows access to a global talent pool, we can express the relationship as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
T_R & = T_0 + \Delta T(R) \\
D_R & = D_0 + \Delta D(R) \\
U_R & = U(T_R, D_R)
\end{align*}
$$

Where:
- $T_R$ and $D_R$ represent the size and diversity of the talent pool with remote work, respectively.
- $T_0$ and $D_0$ represent the initial size and diversity of the talent pool without remote work.
- $\Delta T(R)$ and $\Delta D(R)$ represent the change in size and diversity of the talent pool due to remote work.
- $U_R$ represents the utility function of the organization with remote work.

### Conclusion:
Given that remote work ($R = 1$) generally allows access to a broader and more diverse talent pool compared to in-office work, we expect $\Delta T(R)>0$ and $\Delta D(R)>0$. Therefore, remote work enhances both the size ($T$) and diversity ($D$) of the talent pool, leading to a higher utility function ($U$) for the organization.
